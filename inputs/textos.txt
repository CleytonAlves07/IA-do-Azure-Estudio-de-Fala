I bought a size S and it fit perfectly. I found the zipper a little bit difficult to get up & down due to the side rushing. The color and material are beautiful in person. Amazingly comfortable!



Long waits...BUT FOR GOOD REASON. Some awesome Italian food and great vibes. Contoso Bistro always has live music or events going on to keep you entertained. The food is good enough to keep me entertained though!

        The Contoso Bistro lasagna is a classic! The outdoor back patio is such a vibe, especially in the summer. Great service as well :) Love this place and will be back for more.
